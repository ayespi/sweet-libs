# Sweet Libs

### Build Something

Create an app that demonstrates your subject. It should...
- Be published to a Github repository.
- Be very small, with no more than 50 total lines of code, if possible (**excluding comments**).
- Be well-commented with notes.
- Be a good example of why someone might want to use your code.
- **DO NOT** follow the [DTROTFO](https://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) methodology.

> Once you complete all the above requirements, you may go on to build something larger than 50 lines if you'd like.

### Document It

In your Github repository, include a `readme.md` that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

- Why did you choose this subject?
By default, Meteor applications are Real-time

It appears that this web framework supports the future of the web.
If this is not already the case, users will expect web applications to work near-instantaneously.


  - How were you first made aware of it?
- What problem does it solve?
  - How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
- Why does one use it?
  - What are the alternatives?
  - What is it similar to, if anything?
- What is the history of this technology?
  - Who built it and why?
  - Who is maintaining it?
- What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
- What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
- What resources do you recommend for interested students?
  - What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?
- What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?

Also, please include the instructions necessary to...

- Run your example.
  - Do I need to run `bower install`? Do I need an API key?
- Use your subject.
  - Do I need to include it in my HTML with `<script>` tags? Do I need to `brew install` anything? Can I deploy it to Heroku?

## Suggestions for Subjects

You may chose from but are not limited to following...

- [Phaser JS](http://phaser.io/)
- [Three.js](http://threejs.org/)
- [Angular 2](https://angular.io/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
- [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)
- [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
- Python / [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

> **DO NOT** pick React since we will be learning about that next week.

## Grouping

It's no secret that learning on your own is something you can do outside of GA. However, more often than not, you will be expected to learn things on your own in a vacuum. This is an exercise in *learning to learn*, rather than in learning a new technology. You'll get the greatest amount of value collaborating with someone else: note what they picked up and how.

Additionally, you'll have to do a fraction of the work: one person can work on the documentation, another can work on the example code, and so on. For those of you concerned with completing other work, that would be to your advantage.

That said, we left the groupings open-ended to provide an opportunity for those who really want some dedicated time to research a topic to do so at their leisure. But for the rest of you, grouping will provide a definite long-term advantage.

## Presentations

Each group will have 10 minutes to present what they learned and demo their application.

Some questions you could answer as part of your presentation are:

- Why does this technology exist / what problem does it solve?
- Who built it / who maintains it?
- How does this technology compare to anything we have learned in class so far?
- Where did you go to learn this technology / what are some good resources out there?
- What kind of apps are best suited for this technology?
- What application did you build?
- What do you most like about this technology / what do most not like about it?

## Timeline

**NO LATER THAN 11:00am: EACH TEAM** must indicate what technology they have chosen on the whiteboard in CR5.

**NO LATER THAN 3:00pm: EACH TEAM** must submit a Git issue to the `sweet-libs` repository containing a link to their / their group's main repository. The issue must also include...

- Your comfort score (out of 5).
- Any particular sections of your code that you would like the instructors to review, and specific questions to guide our feedback.

**3:30pm: ALL STUDENTS** will re-convene in their classroom for presentations.
